                          <p>
                                We’ve made QuantifiedDev - platform and plugins - open source which means you can be part of our mission.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We’re building features and plugin support as fast as we can at QuantifiedDev, but we’re only able to address a small fraction of the available data that’s out there. It’s a huge challenge!
                            </p>
                            <p class="italic">
                                That’s where you come in.
                            </p>
                            <p>The best way to help us is to support our plugin development. I bet you’re using a tool or IDE that we haven’t built a plugin for yet. That’s one thing about developers, we’re highly individualistic and everyone has their favourite tool. So, if you’re writing, building and testing software with tools we don’t support, we’d love you to get involved by creating yourself a plugin.
                            </p>
                            <p>Or if you want to extend the existing plugins with an interesting new data point, we’d love to hear about that too.
                            </p>
                            <p>We’re not quite ready to accept help on the platform, but if you want to help, let us know and we can reach out to you when we’re ready.</p>
                            <p>To get involved, simply email the team, <a href="mailto:team@quantifieddev.org">team@quantifieddev.org</a>, and we can take it from there.
