                                We value your privacy. Your data is your data. Identifiable and individual data will always remain private unless you choose to share it. If there are large enough data groups to aggregate your data into without it there being a possibility of identifying you then we will do this so that we can show you comparisons of your data versus the average of a certain group - e.g. How do I compare to other developers in my city?
                            </p>

                                You can export your data from QuantifiedDev at any time if you want to use it elsewhere. You can also delete your data from QuantifiedDev at any time, though we hope you won't want to.
                            </p>
